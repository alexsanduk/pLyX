# pLyX System
The pLyX system is a scripting system for LyX. Or rather, LyX has a built-in scripting system, but it seems to have been created by accident, few know of it, and it has certainly received no development to make its use convenient for the user. The pLyX system is an attempt to create a workable interface for this system out of the tools that LyX provides -- modules, custom insets, toolbar buttons -- and also to provide some initial scripts.
